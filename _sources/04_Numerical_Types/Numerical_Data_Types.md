# Numerical Data Types

- In Python, we majorly have 5 numeric data types. Those are :

  1. **Integers Numbers (Z)** : Integer values are 0,1,2,-2 etc. In python we call it as `int`.
  2. **Rational Numbers (Q)** : The numbers which are in p/q form i.e {p/q | p,q belongs to Z where q!=0}. In python rational numbers are represented by `Fractions` class.
  3. **Real Numbers (R)** : Real Numbers are just decimal numbers. In python we represent real numbers as `float`, `Decimal` etc.
  4. **Complex Numbers (C)** : The numbers which are in te form of {a+ib | a,b belongs to R}. In python, we represent complex numbers with `complex` class.
  5. **Boolean Values** : Boolean Values are just True(1) or False(0). In python, we represent these numbers with `bool` class.
