# First Class Functions

- In Python, <b>first class functions</b> means that functions can be treated like any other object that means they can be treated as data so that they can be assigned, passed, returned, and stored.

- A function is considered as first class if it can :

  1. Be assigned to a variable.
  2. Be passed as an argument to another function.
  3. Be returned from another function.
  4. Be stored in data structure like lists, dictionaries etc.

- If any function or object exhibits the above charecteristics then that function can be considered as first class function or first class object.

- <b>Higher Order Functions</b> are functions that take function as an argument or return a function. 

- So simply first class functions are functions that are treated as values or data.
