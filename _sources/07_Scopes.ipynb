Since we haven't defined it in global namespace then it moves to next level scope which is on top of global scope. Here it is `built-in scope`. Since `print` already defined in `built-in scope`, so it runs that functionality. Next it encounters `a`. So it first checks whether `a` is defined in global scope or not.
